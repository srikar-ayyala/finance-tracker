Monorepo full stack application that takes bank transaction and helps sort into a collective, easy to search format

Goal of this project:

- Read and parse csv file from banking apps.
- Give easy way to categorize and tag transactions.
    - One way is to have a excel style ui with a list of all the transaction and tags.
    - Second way is to iterate through all the transactions one by one, showing only one at a time and having a tags input field.
    - Having a list of commonly used tags, individual or group, for easy copy, paste or select.
- Visualize total spending and earnings based on the tags, categories and time period.
